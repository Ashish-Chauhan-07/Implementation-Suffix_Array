# Implementation-Suffix_Array
Implementing a Suffix Array that is capable of performing given operations on Strings in a most efficient way.
<br><br>
- Given a string S print its minimum lexicographic rotation. O(nlogn)
- Given an integer K, print the length of the longest substring that appears in the text at least K times. If no such substring exists, print 1. O(nlogn)
- Given a string S determine its longest substring that is also a palindrome. In the case of multiple solutions, print the lexicographically smallest palindrome. O(nlogn)
